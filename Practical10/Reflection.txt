In this practical, I tried SIR models to simulate infectious disease spread. It was complex and a bit challenging, especially the probabilistic calculations. However, I found visualising the impact of different parameters on disease progression really rewarding and insightful, which I enjoyed the most. I also learnt important ways of thinking, such as using arrays for multi-dimensional simulation. This improved my understanding of epidemiological modelling and developed my programming skills.
