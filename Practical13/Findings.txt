The alighment score: HUMAN-RAT(3107)<HUMAN-MOUSE(3137)<MOUSE-RAT(3261)
The percentage of identical amino acids: HUMAN-RAT(0.917)<HUMAN-MOUSE(0.925)<MOUSE-RAT(0.968)

Higher alighment score and higher percentage of identical amino acids represent higher similarity. 
1.MOUSE-RAT sequences have the highest alighment score and the highest percentage of identical amino acids, indicating that the mouse and rat sequences are most closely related.
2.The alighment score and the percentage of identical amino acids: HUMAN-MOUSE>HUMAN-RAT, indicating that the human SLC6A4 gene sequence is more like that of the mouse.
3.The human SLC6A4 gene sequence is less like that of the rat, meaning that there are more variations. So the rat would be a better model organism for studying variation in the SLC6A4 gene in humans.
